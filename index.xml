      <description>Hello, my name is Kenta and I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineering student studying at the University of Alberta. My passion is programming and I have a strong interest in large scale infrastructure.
Previously, I had the opportunity to work on the Valorant core services team at Riot Games. There, I had the fantastic opportunity to work on the back-end services that Valorant relies on for its online features.
I also worked at Demonware Inc.</description>
