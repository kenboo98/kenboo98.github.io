      <description>Hello, my name is Kenta and I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineering student studying at the University of Alberta. My passion is programming and I have a strong interest in large scale infrastructure.
Previously, I worked at Demonware Inc. in Vancouver, BC as an intern on the Capacity Planning and Monitoring Team. I worked with Monitoring infrastructure that monitors some of the biggest Activision titles such as Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot.</description>
